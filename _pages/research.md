This repository contains the data and code used in our paper, "Enabling Artificial Intelligence into Cybersecurity Education: A Comprehensive Data-driven Approach".

Cybersecurity researchers and practitioners have determined that modern cybersecurity methods are increasingly using AI techniques. However, the cybersecurity curriculum has not been updated to integrate such topics or techniques. Therefore, we find it imperative to find relevant topics in AI that are most commonly used within cybersecurity in order to form an explicit AI module that integrates AI concepts into cybersecurity.

We ask the questions: What are the most common correlations between AI and cybersecurity topics? What are suitable AI topics to integrate in a module within the context of cybersecurity?

To that end, we follow a methodology that considers over 5000 research papers from top-tier cybersecurity conferences and journals (e.g., NDSS, USENIX, ACM CCS, IEEE S\&P, and IEEE TIFS). We extracted AI-related keywords and used Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify AI concepts. Furthermore, we extracted cybersecurity keywords from a cybersecurity pilot course, incorporating additional keywords from cybersecurity academic textbooks. We used the extracted keywords to create a co-occurrence matrix. Finally, we created a specific AI module using the co-occurrence matrix for a cybersecurity course within an academic institution.

## EAGER SaTC-EDU: Evaluating AI in the Cybersecurity Program

<h4>[Enhancing Cybersecurity Education with Artificial Intelligence Content](https://github.com/cslfiu/NSF_Eager_SaTC_Project_2)</h4>

This repository contains the data and code used in our paper, "Enhancing Cybersecurity Education Through the Lens of Artificial Intelligence".

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a fundamental tool for cybersecurity researchers and practitioners. It is frequently used to address major security problems such as supply chain attacks, ransomware threats, and social engineering. Yet, the current cybersecurity curriculum still suffers from the absence of AI resources, particularly the detailed understanding of the appropriate AI mechanisms.

To address this, we consider a methodology where we design an AI lecture module that can be integrated into any cybersecurity course. We then present the module to several cybersecurity courses in our institution and assess their performance before and after the lecture. Our AI lecture is composed of a pre-lecture survey, the AI module, live AI examples, and a post-lecture survey.
