# Enabling Artificial Intelligence into Cybersecurity Education: A Comprehensive Data-driven Approach

This repository contains the data and code used in our paper, "Enabling Artificial Intelligence into Cybersecurity Education: A Comprehensive Data-driven Approach".

In the first step, we explain our data collection process. In the second step, we provide the code for our data preprocessing and analysis. Our data collection is located under a different folder that can be used to replicate our results. Finally, in the third step, we provide the code to visualize our results. To reproduce our results, you can use our raw data and proceed to the second step.

# [1. Data Collection](#1-data-collection)
For our data collection, we gathered over 5000 cybersecurity research papers from top cybersecurity conferences and journals (e.g., NDSS, USENIX, ACM CCS, and IEEE S&P). We gathered papers concerning computer security topics. After we collected our raw data, we adjusted a pre-trained model to filter the papers that have a higher probability of using AI topics. We then divide the papers into three distinct categories: AI-positive, AI-neutral, and AI-negative. For our analysis and results, we only considered the AI-positive papers.
